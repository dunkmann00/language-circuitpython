# Atom CircuitPython

This is a very much WIP package which will display the output from CircuitPython devices inside a window in your Atom editor.

So far I can only partially guarantee support on MacOS as that is what I developed it on. Windows will most likely not work but you may have  some luck with Linux.

Open to any form of feedback in the form of GitHub Issues or you can ping me (joseph#1337) in the `#circuitpython` channel of the [Adafruit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).
