# Atom CircuitPython

This is a very much WIP package which will display the output from CircuitPython devices inside a window in your Atom editor.

It is **highly recommended** that you use the [`fsync-on-save`](https://atom.io/packages/fsync-on-save) package with this package to ensure data integrity while working with circuitpython devices in Atom, please read the documentation on that package for additional information.

Should be compatible with Windows & Linux as the serial port library *should* be cross-platform, let me know in the issues of any errors cropping up.

Open to any form of feedback in the form of GitHub Issues or you can ping me (joseph#1337) in the `#circuitpython` channel of the [Adafruit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).
