# Atom CircuitPython

CircuitPython language support in Atom. Support for serial outputs, Python REPL, and plotting of data.

This plugin contains the code from the [`fsync-on-save`](https://atom.io/packages/fsync-on-save) package to ensure data is flushed to the device immediately after saving, therefore preventing loss or corruption of data when working with CircuitPython devices.

Should be compatible with Windows & Linux as the serial port library *should* be cross-platform, let me know in the issues of any errors cropping up.

Open to any form of feedback in the form of GitHub Issues or you can ping me (joseph#1337) in the `#circuitpython` channel of the [Adafruit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).
